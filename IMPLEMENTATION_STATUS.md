# Supabase Invitation System Implementation Status

## ✅ Completed Features

### Core User State Management
- ✅ Updated `useAuth` hook with user state detection
- ✅ Added user states: `not_signed_up`, `unconfirmed`, `confirmed_no_organization`, `confirmed_with_organization`
- ✅ Role constants and helpers (`owner`/`user` roles)

### Pages & Routing
- ✅ `/auth/confirm` - Handles email confirmation and routing logic
- ✅ `/onboarding/create-organization` - Organization creation form with address fields
- ✅ Updated middleware for proper state-based routing

### Organization Management
- ✅ `createOrganization` function with all address fields:
  - `name` (required)
  - `address_line_1` (required)
  - `address_line_2` (optional)
  - `city` (required)
  - `state` (required)
  - `zip_code` (required)
- ✅ Auto-generates slug from organization name
- ✅ Prevents multiple organization creation per owner
- ✅ Automatic owner role assignment

### Error Handling
- ✅ Multiple organization creation error
- ✅ Email confirmation resend functionality
- ✅ Form validation with Zod schemas

## 📋 User Flow Implementation

### Direct Signup Flow ✅
1. User visits `/auth` → Signs up → `unconfirmed` state
2. User clicks email link → `/auth/confirm` → `confirmed_no_organization`
3. Auto-redirect to `/onboarding/create-organization`
4. User creates organization → Becomes `owner` → `confirmed_with_organization`
5. Redirect to `/` (main app)

### Middleware Routing Logic ✅
- `not_signed_up` → `/auth`
- `unconfirmed` → `/auth/confirm` (can access auth pages)
- `confirmed_no_organization` → `/onboarding/create-organization`
- `confirmed_with_organization` → Full app access (blocks auth/onboarding)

## 🚀 Ready for Testing

The core system is implemented and ready for testing. Test the flow:

1. Sign up a new user at `/auth`
2. Check email and click confirmation link
3. Should redirect to organization creation
4. Fill out organization form
5. Should redirect to main app as owner

## 🔄 Future Enhancements (Not Implemented Yet)

### Invitation System
- `/api/invite-user` API route with service role key
- Owner UI for sending invitations
- Invited user flow (auto-organization assignment)

### Additional Features
- Password reset flow
- User management for owners
- Organization settings
- Role-based permissions throughout app

## 🛠️ Database Schema

Current schema supports the implementation:
- `profiles`: User profile data
- `organizations`: Organization data with address fields
- `user_organizations`: User-organization relationships with roles

## 📝 Environment Variables Needed

For future invitation system:
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (for API routes only, never client-side)

Current implementation works without additional environment variables.
