# Realtime text & data

> Exchange text, files, and custom data between participants.

- **[Sending text](https://docs.livekit.io/home/client/data/text-streams.md)**: Use text streams to send and receive text data, such as LLM responses or chat messages.

- **[Sending files & bytes](https://docs.livekit.io/home/client/data/byte-streams.md)**: Use byte streams to transfer files, images, or any other binary data.

- **[Remote method calls](https://docs.livekit.io/home/client/data/rpc.md)**: Use RPC to execute custom methods on other participants in the room and await a response.

For low-level control over individual packet behavior, LiveKit also includes a simple [data packets](https://docs.livekit.io/home/client/data/packets.md) API.
